This is a very basic mod that adds recipes I feel make the multiplayer crafting experience easier.
The mod can be used in singleplayer, and I also recommend that.
Those recipes are:

- Some unique Calamity items
- Bulk ore smelting for vanilla, Calamity, and Vitality

v1.4.2 Changes:
- Fixed Calamity integration (removed Ancient Shiv from Murasama recipe)
