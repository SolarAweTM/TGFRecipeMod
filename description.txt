This is a very basic mod for a very specific server. It adds and removes certain recipes.
Those recipes are:

- Most Calamity shrine items
- Murasama, Terminus, and the Dragon Scales
- Removed recipes for Item Frame and Weapon Rack

I wouldn't recommend using this unless you need these EXACT changes.
