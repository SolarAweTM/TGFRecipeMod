This is a very basic mod that adds recipes I feel make the multiplayer crafting experience easier.
The mod can be used in singleplayer, and I also recommend that.
Those recipes are:

- Some unique Calamity items
- Bulk ore smelting for vanilla, Calamity, and Vitality

This does have integration with Calamity, but Calamity is still being ported to 1.4.

v1.4 Changes (tMod 1.4 only):
- Ported to 1.4
- Added Vitality integration for bulk recipes
- Removed recipe removals and edits as they are no longer needed
- Removed Catalyst integration
- Adjusted bulk ore smelting for 1.4 numbers

v1.3.2 Changes:
- Added the rest of bulk crafting bars
- Calamity:
  - Added bulk crafting for all bars and cores

v1.3.1 Changes:
- Fixed bulk crafting recipes

v1.3 Changes:
- Added bulk recipes for pre-hardmode bars
- Mod no longer requires Calamity, all recipes are intact

v1.2.2 Changes:

  - Recipe changes based on if you have the Catalyst Mod enabled or not
  - Catalyst is NOT required
